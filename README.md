## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account to access the [Google Maps API](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Google Maps Embed API Key.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-maps-embed.git
   cd google-maps-embed
   ```

2. **Obtain a Google Maps API Key**

   To use Google Maps, you'll need an API key. You can get it by following these steps:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Enable the **Maps Embed API**.
   - Generate an API key.

3. **Embed the Google Map**

   Open the `index.html` file and replace the placeholder `<YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>` with your actual API key:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>Embedded Google Map</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Our Location</h1>
     <iframe
       width="600"
       height="450"
       style="border: 0"
       loading="lazy"
       allowfullscreen
       src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&q=New+York+City">
     </iframe>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Replace `"New+York+City"` with the location of your choice, and ensure the `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is replaced with your actual API key.

4. **Open the Webpage**

   After adding your API key, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see the embedded Google Map with the specified location.

## Usage

You can easily embed a Google Map into your webpage by following these simple steps:

1. **Adjust Map Location:** Change the `q` parameter in the iframe's `src` URL to the desired location (e.g., `q=Los+Angeles` or `q=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA`).
2. **Change Map Size:** Adjust the `width` and `height` attributes of the iframe to suit your design.
3. **Allow Map Interactions:** The embedded map is interactive by default, meaning users can zoom and pan around the map.

### Example

Embed a map for a specific address:

```html
<iframe
   width="600"
   height="450"
   style="border:0"
   loading="lazy"
   allowfullscreen
   src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&q=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA">
</iframe>
```

### Example Usage for Different Locations

1. **New York City**:

   ```html
   <iframe
       width="600"
       height="450"
       style="border:0"
       loading="lazy"
       allowfullscreen
       src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&q=New+York+City">
